## Learned from R

As a new student on R, I've learned some interesting new ideas!

### Basic Math

Below you will find how to do basic math **addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.**   

```{r addition, subtraction, multiplcation, division}
5+4
3-2
4/1
3*4
5+4+3*14-2/2
```

### Reading Data into R

You can also read and plot data into R! 

```{r readr}
library(datasets)
plot(iris)
```

### Summarazing Data 

You can also use head() to see the first few lines of a table.

```{r}
library(datasets)
head(iris)
```
